## Education

I'm a fourth-year Environmental Studies student at **UC Santa Barbara**, passionate about the intersection of science, sustainability, and community impact. My academic journey has focused on understanding the environmental challenges our world faces—from climate change to conservation—and exploring innovative, practical solutions. Whether I'm conducting field research, analyzing energy systems, or working on community-based projects, I’m driven by a deep commitment to protecting ecosystems and promoting environmental justice.

## Experience

### The Green Initiative Fund (TGIF)

In 2023 I was on a team of 3 UCSB Interns working to make an online inventory system for UCSB's Surplus sales. This is how the University recycles inventorial items. All items purchchased by the University needs to go through a tedious procurment process before it can be recycled, trashed, or resold through the Surplus process. Me and my team were hired to create a cleaner system to track all outgoing items and also market them to the University and even the Public through the University's Gateway system. Before our project was funded, this entire process was like a garage sale every Tuesday in a lot. Our goal was to make Items purchasable online to generate more sales.

### The Nature Conservancy and the Cheadle Center

In the Fall of 2024 I was hired as a "Trail Educator" at the Jack and Laura Dangermond nature preserve located about 40min North of Santa Barbara. Here the goal was to get kids to connect to native California nature. This program targeted the less fortunate schools to get them interested in climate change and general wildife. This was a part of the kids in nature program as well. As a trail educator I led middle schoolers and highschoolers on a 5 mile hike in an Oakland Chapperal where we pointed out native and non native species to the students along the way. This experience truely touched my soul as I felt like I was inspiring young children who don't get these hiking adventours as much as other schools might provide for thier students. This was by far my favorite experience during my college experience.

### Admin Assistant for UCSB Information Technology Services (ITS)

In 2024 I accepted a role as an Admin assistant for UCSB's Information Technology Services department. Here I learned many clerical skills including Excel, Atlassin, Confluence, Canva, Visio ext. I help do digital filing, purchasing, and billing as well as office task to support the department. I also do some departamental planning for events such as UCSB's annual Forward together event which aims to get the department (who are mostly remote) to bond and get excited as a team.

I joined UCSB's Club Frisbee team my freshman year and boy am I glad I did. This team has given me so many experiences whether that be traveling, a consistent workout schedule, an officer role in a club (social chair), and life long friends.

### Running and Hiking

In the spring of last year, I helped my buddy, Braden Boyles, start a run club to raise for suicide awareness called "Santa Barbarian Run Club". For this club I designed the T-shirt logo and helped organize runs which was a lot of fun! In November I ran my first 1/2 marathon with my mom, who jump started my running itch. In 2023 I tore my ACL and was unable to run for 6 months. As an active person, this was very hard for me, as this is one of my main stress relievers. Now that I can run again, i never want to stop, and I love getting other people into it as well!

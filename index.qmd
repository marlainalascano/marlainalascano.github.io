Hello!

I’m Marlaina Lascano — a UCSB Environmental Science undergraduate (Graduating in 10 days), field researcher, and creative force. From the coasts of California to remote ecosystems like the Dangermond Preserve, I’m passionate about sustainability, science communication, and community-driven change. I also have many hobbies that keep me busy and challenged!

    "text": "Experience\n\nThe Green Initiative Fund (TGIF)\nIn 2023 I was on a team of 3 UCSB Interns working to make an online inventory system for UCSB’s Surplus sales. This is how the University recycles inventorial items. All items purchchased by the University needs to go through a tedious procurment process before it can be recycled, trashed, or resold through the Surplus process. Me and my team were hired to create a cleaner system to track all outgoing items and also market them to the University and even the Public through the University’s Gateway system. Before our project was funded, this entire process was like a garage sale every Tuesday in a lot. Our goal was to make Items purchasable online to generate more sales.\n\n\nThe Nature Conservancy and the Cheadle Center\nIn the Fall of 2024 I was hired as a “Trail Educator” at the Jack and Laura Dangermond nature preserve located about 40min North of Santa Barbara. Here the goal was to get kids to connect to native California nature. This program targeted the less fortunate schools to get them interested in climate change and general wildife. This was a part of the kids in nature program as well. As a trail educator I led middle schoolers and highschoolers on a 5 mile hike in an Oakland Chapperal where we pointed out native and non native species to the students along the way. This experience truely touched my soul as I felt like I was inspiring young children who don’t get these hiking adventours as much as other schools might provide for thier students. This was by far my favorite experience during my college experience.\n\n\nAdmin Assistant for UCSB Information Technology Services (ITS)\nIn 2024 I accepted a role as an Admin assistant for UCSB’s Information Technology Services department. Here I learned many clerical skills including Excel, Atlassin, Confluence, Canva, Visio ext. I help do digital filing, purchasing, and billing as well as office task to support the department. I also do some departamental planning for events such as UCSB’s annual Forward together event which aims to get the department (who are mostly remote) to bond and get excited as a team."

This team has given me so many experiences whether that be traveling, a consistent workout schedule, an officer role in a club (social chair), and life long friends.\n\n\nRunning and Hiking\n \nIn the spring of last year, I helped my buddy, Braden Boyles, start a run club to raise for suicide awareness called “Santa Barbarian Run Club”. For this club I designed the T-shirt logo and helped organize runs which was a lot of fun! In November I ran my first 1/2 marathon with my mom, who jump started my running itch. In 2023 I tore my ACL and was unable to run for 6 months. As an active person, this was very hard for me, as this is one of my main stress relievers. Now that I can run again, i never want to stop, and I love getting other people into it as well!"

    "text": "ENVS 193 DS: Statistics for Environmental Science\nFor my project in this class I collected date for 30 days to track how the amount of protein, and the amount of food I ate everyday affected my overall mood. I then loaded all the data into R Studio to create a figure (represented below) to show how these factors truly affected me.\nTo code this First I loaded all the necessary packages. I then loaded my data, which I downloaded from Google Sheets as a csv file. I then calculated the medians of my hourly sleep per night over the 30 days and the amount of protein I ate per day in grams. From here I then started creating grouping variables of High and Low sleep and High and Low protein intake based on my calculated medians . I then was able to create a plot with these group variable that depicted a bar graph and jitter plot at the same time to show the true values. I color coded the sections and labeld my axis. To complete the graph I took off the legend and it was complete.\n\n#load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmy_data &lt;- read_csv(\"193_Mood_Data - Sheet1.csv\") #read in data\n\nRows: 30 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): day\ndbl (4): mood, Protien, alcohol, sleep\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nsleep_median &lt;- median(my_data$sleep, na.rm = TRUE) #calculate medians\nprotein_median &lt;- median(my_data$Protien, na.rm = TRUE) #calculate medians\n \nmy_data &lt;- my_data %&gt;% #creating grouping variables\n  mutate(\n    sleep_group = if_else(sleep &gt;= sleep_median, \"High Sleep\", \"Low Sleep\"), #this creates 2 groups based on the median hours of sleep I got in the 30 data points\n    protein_group = if_else(Protien &gt;= protein_median, \"High Protein\", \"Low Protein\"),#this creates 2 groups based on the median hours of protein I got in the 30 data points\n    group = paste(sleep_group, protein_group, sep = \" & \")\n  ) \n \n group_means &lt;- my_data %&gt;% #calculating group means\n  group_by(group) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_mood = mean(mood, na.rm = TRUE))\n \n# Create the plot\nggplot(my_data, aes(x = group, y = mood, fill = group)) +\n  geom_bar(data = group_means, aes(x = group, y = mean_mood), stat = \"identity\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, size = 2, alpha = 0.8, color = \"black\") + #greats the black data points\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"High Sleep & High Protein\" = \"#1b9e77\", #creates the color coded sections\n                               \"High Sleep & Low Protein\" = \"#d95f02\",\n                               \"Low Sleep & High Protein\" = \"#7570b3\",\n                               \"Low Sleep & Low Protein\" = \"#e7298a\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Mood by Sleep and Protein Intake\", #title \n    x = \"Sleep and Protein Intake Group\", #title of x axis\n    y = \"Mood Score\", #title of y axis\n    fill = \"Group\" \n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

This project involved a week-long personal energy audit to assess the scale of my energy consumption and related carbon emissions across electricity use, heating, and transportation. I tracked 10 activities—such as cooking, commuting, and digital device use—logging their duration or distance and estimating the associated energy use and emissions. Using standardized emission factors and Excel-based calculations, I determined the total energy in kilojoules and CO₂ emissions in kilograms for each activity. The project concluded with a written analysis identifying the most energy-intensive and carbon-heavy activities, offering insights into my personal environmental impact and opportunities for reduction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge\n\n\nFrom this workbook I was able to conclude that driving and cooking were my highest emitting activities throughout the week. Part of this assignment was to calculate the CO2 emissions from a recent trip you went on and compare it to your weekly output. That summer I had driven to Seattle WA from Santa Barbara and my emissions from that road trip we almost 100x more than my weekly output. This project help me put into perspective the real harm driving has on the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to enlarge"
